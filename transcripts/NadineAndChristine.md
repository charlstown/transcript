Therapist: So, how have the two of you been? 

Woman A: You can talk.

Woman B: It's been a little rough. I will say after that session, I, like, *sucked really well.*

Therapist: Sounds nice.

Woman B: I'm trusting.

Woman A: Yeah, I feel like we pulled on something and unraveled the whole sweater.

Therapist: Yeah. Because you know what it was?

Woman A: What was the thread?

Woman B: I don’t think I was recognizing how *frustrated* I was with the relationship. Even just with myself. I feel, honestly, like I’ve lied to myself for… most— like, *most* always. And I feel like that thread was like this thread of *truth.* And then the whole thing just, like… *yeah.*

Therapist: Any thoughts?

Woman A: So, I think those realizations—well, I don’t want to be *this* quick— but… we’re breaking up, essentially. Or trying to figure out how to decouple in an *ethical* way.

Woman B: She asked me if I felt like I was in love with her. I said, *Well, I don’t know. I don’t know.* I haven’t necessarily *felt* that. We haven’t *felt* that in a while.

Woman A: I guess what Nadine also said is… she’s not sure if she’s polyamorous anymore. She’s not sure if she can *manage* being—

Woman B: I feel *very* confused. So I was like, *Okay, our entire relationship has revolved around non-monogamy and polyamory.* And I feel that you have *used* polyamory as a vehicle to *leave me.* And I’m *mad.* I’m *really* mad. I’m *disappointed.*  

Woman A: I don’t know if I need to move out. And I don’t have enough to try to find a new place to live and maintain rent. So, I don’t know if we should, like, *push through it.*

Woman B: And I’m *team push through it,* personally.

Therapist: *Push through it* means?

Woman B: I just feel like… we’re living under the same roof until—

Woman A: The lease is up.

Woman B: So it’s like, one option is to stay, and the other option is to figure out how to cancel the lease and then each move out.

Woman A: And my *lot*— I have, like, *zero.* I’m, like, fighting— my *life* aside from this is in *shambles.* I need to, like, *get my situation together.*

Therapist: What’s happening with your life?

Woman A: I have no *fight* in it. Everything— everything got *fucked up.*

Therapist: Tell me.

Woman A: So, simultaneously with *this*… I, um… I always worked with my family. With my dad and all that.

Therapist: What kind of work is that?

Woman A: Like, cars and stuff like that. But moving to New York, I stopped working for my family. This is also when I *came out.*

Therapist: And then?

Woman A: *That* totally unraveled my family dynamic. And then…

Woman B: Your dad?

Woman A: My dad… he’s just, like, gotten totally… uh—

Therapist: Yeah?

Woman A: Yeah. No, he doesn’t— at this point, he doesn’t have a *relationship* with me.

Therapist: He doesn’t want to have a relationship with you since you came out?

Woman A: Just… for him, it’s all together. Because, like— I moved here. Then I *became* gay.

Therapist: *Because* you just became gay.

Woman A: Right. So, in his eyes, I’m *not working.* I’m *doing drugs.* I’ve *literally* lost my mind. And I’m with a *woman.*

Woman A: So I’m, like, trying to, like, *put pieces back together* while this is all happening.

Therapist: It sounds like a *crisis.*

Woman A: Oh. *Big time.* Yeah.

Woman B: Yeah.

Woman A: So, our *last* conversation was—he didn’t want to have a relationship. He was like, *night and day different.*

Therapist: How so?

Woman A: Oh, he was like—he’s like, *This weed is a cat.* He was, like, a little special to him. A little bit of a water, yeah, and, like— if I walked into the room, it was *all* face lit up. Everyone *knew*, like— any cauliflower.

Woman B: And now?

Woman A: Now it’s like— as if that never was even *real* or anything.

Therapist: Because it *feels* not real.

Woman A: Because the minute I *veer* from the course…

Therapist: I mean, it’s *conditional.* The most *transactional* and *conditional* love *ever.*

Woman A: Yeah. *Very* confusing.

Therapist: And you’re describing a relationship in which, first of all, there’s a great deal of *dependence*— dependence that has been fostered— and in a way, needing to *negate yourself* to keep that going. Negate your ability to *stand on your own feet.*

Therapist: It’s like choosing between *yourself* and the love of your father.
