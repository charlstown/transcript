Man: Aren't you gonna eat that?

Woman: How’d you do something?

Man: What do you mean?

Woman: I don’t know.

Man: What does that mean?

Woman: I don’t know.

Man: What does that mean?

Woman: I don’t know.

Man: Is there something you wanted to do? Something you want to do?

Woman: Like what?

Man: I don’t know. If you’re so good at so many things, you could do anything you wanted to do. You’re good at everything that you do. Isn’t there something else you want to do?

Woman: Then what? Then be your husband? Be Frankie’s dad? What do you want me to do?

Man: What— in your, like, dream scenario of me doing what I’m good at—what would that be?

Woman: I don’t know. I just mean, you’re so good at so many things. You can do so many things. You have such capacity.

Man: For what?

Woman: I don’t know. You can sing. You can draw. You can dance.

Man: Listen, I didn’t want to be somebody’s husband, okay? And I didn’t want to be somebody’s dad. That wasn’t my goal in life. For some guys, it is. It wasn’t mine. But somehow, it was what I wanted. I didn’t know that. And now, it’s all I want to do. I don’t want to do anything else. That’s what I want to do. I work so I can do that.

Woman: I’d like to see you have a job where you didn’t have to start drinking at eight o’clock in the morning to go to it.

Man: No. I have a job where I *can* drink at eight o’clock in the morning. What a luxury, you know? I get up for work, I have a beer, I go to work, I paint somebody’s house, they’re excited about it. I come home. *This* is the dream.

Woman: It doesn’t ever disappoint you?

Man: Why would it disappoint me? I can still do whatever I could do.

Woman: So what? Why do you have to make money off your potential?

Man: Look, I’m not even saying you have to make money off your potential.

Woman: What does *potential* mean? What does that even mean?

Man: Potential for what? To turn it into what?

Woman: We rarely sit down and have an adult conversation because every time we do, you take what I say and twist it into something I didn’t mean. You just twist it. Start blabbing. *Blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab.* If you’re not interested in what I have to say, then maybe I just shouldn’t say anything.
