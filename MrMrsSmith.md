### Transcript

```yml
Man: Okay, I'll go first. Let me say, we don't really need to be here. See, we've been married five years.

Woman: Six.

Man: Five, six years. And this is like a checkup for us. A chance to poke around the engine. Maybe change the oil. Replace a seal or two.

Therapist: Very well then. Let's pop the hood. On a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you as a couple?

Woman: Eight.

Therapist: Wait. Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable. Or just respond instinctively.

Man: Okay.

Therapist: Ready?

Man & Woman: Ready.

Man & Woman: Eight.

Therapist: How often do you have sex?

Man: I don't understand the question.

Woman: Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a 1 to 10 thing?

Man: Because is 1 very little, or is 1 nothing? Because technically speaking, zero would be nothing.

Woman: That's right. And if we don't know what 1 is, what's 10?

Man: Yeah, is 10 *constant, unrelenting,* never stopping, like 9 to 10 times a day?

Woman: *Not* indeed. 

Man: Like *Sting?*  

Woman: Well, look, it's *Sting's* day job. Who else is having sex *six days a week* and putting in the work?

Therapist: It's not a 1 to 10 scenario. It's a basic question. How often do you have sex?

Man: How about this week?

Therapist: Including the weekend?

Man: Sure.

Therapist: Describe how you first met.

Man: It was in Colombia.

Woman: *Bogot√°.* Five years ago.

Man: Six.

Woman: Right. Five or six years ago.
