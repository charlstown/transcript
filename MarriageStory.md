```yml
Woman: You're being so much like your father.

Man: Do not compare me to my father.

Woman: I didn’t compare you, Dan. I said you were *acting* like him.

Man: You're exactly like your mother. Everything you complain about her, you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

Woman: First of all, I *love* my mother. She was a wonderful mother.

Man: You're repeating what you told me.

Woman: How dare you compare my mother— *into* my mother? I may be like my father, but I am *not* like my mother.

Man: You are. And you're like my father. You're also like my mother. You're all the bad things about all of these people. But *mostly* your mother. 

Man: When we would lie in bed together, sometimes I would look at you and see her. I’d just feel so *gross.* I felt *repulsed* when you touched me.

Woman: You're a *slob.* I made all the beds, closed all the cabinets— 

Man: And you wanted to *peel your skin off.*

Woman: You'll never be happy. And now, lying here, *anywhere*— you think you've found some better, *opposite* guy than me. And in a few years, you'll rebel against him. 

Man: Because you *need* to have your voice. But you don’t *want* a voice. You just want to fucking *complain* about not having a voice.

Woman: Thinking about being married to you? That was *suicide.* I mean, we had a child marriage. You've gone back to your life before you met me—it's *pathetic.* 

Man: People used to tell me that you were too selfish to be a great artist. And I used to *defend* you. They were *absolutely* right.

Woman: All your best acting is *behind you.* You're back to being a *hack.*

Man: You gaslight me. You’re a *fucking villain.* You want to present yourself as a *victim* because it's a good *legal strategy?* Fine. 

Man: But you and I both know—you *chose* this life.

Woman: *You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man.* 

Man: Stop it.

Woman: *You're a good man. You're a good man. You're a good man.* 

Man: Stop!

Woman: *Police! Police! Police! Police!* 

Man: *Please stop!*

Woman: You stopped having sex with me in the last year.

Man: I never cheated on you.

Woman: *What?* 

Man: I *never* cheated on you. But there was so much I *could* have done. I was a director in my 20s who came from *nothing* and was suddenly on the cover of *fucking* Time Out New York. 

Man: I was *hot shit* and I wanted to *fuck everybody.* And I *didn’t.* Because I *loved you.* I didn’t want to lose you. 

Man: But I had *made* my 20s and I didn’t want to *lose that too.* And I kind of *did.* And you wanted *so much, so fast.* I didn’t even want to get married.

Man: *Fuck it!* There’s so much I didn’t do.

Woman: Thanks for that.

Man: You’re *welcome.*

Woman: I can’t believe I could know you *forever!*

Man: *You’re fucking insane.*

Woman: And you’re *fucking winning!*

Man: Are you kidding me? I *wanted* to be married. I’d already *lost.*

Woman: You didn’t love me as much as I loved you.

Man: What does that have to do with LA?

Woman: *What?* 

Man: You’re so *merged* with your own selfishness, you don’t even *identify it* as selfishness anymore.

Woman: You’re such a *dick!* 

Woman: Every day, I wake up and I *hope you're dead.* 

Man: What?

Woman: If I could *guarantee* Henry would be okay, I’d hope you’d get an *illness.* If you got *hit by a car and died*— 

Woman: *I wouldn’t care.*

Man: …I'm sorry.

Woman: *I'm sorry.*

Man: It hurts.

Woman: *It hurts.*

Man: I'm sorry.

Woman: *It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.*

Man: I'm sorry.

Woman: One more time. 

Man: One more time.

Woman: John.

Man: John.
