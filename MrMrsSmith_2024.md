Man: No, you just don’t like that I was doing it well without you. That’s the problem.

Therapist: Oh, and you feel that this bothers Jane?

Man: I *know* it does. I mean, if we’re being honest, I was bonding with Black people.

Woman (Jane): Oh my God.

Man: And it was something that she can’t do as well. So I had access in a way that she will *never* have. And it bothered her.

Woman: You were in there with these guys. They were just talking about different kinds of girls and *submissive* girls. I mean, you were bonding over being sexist. That’s what it was.

Therapist: How so? Say more about that.

Man: No, we were talking about Maya.

Woman: What ever *happened* to Maya?

Man: That’s exactly what we were talking about! We were saying, *I think she married rich* and then was like, *I just don’t need this* and just decided to be on her own. 

Man: She was like, *Oh, I’m just going to—* but I just— we were like, *Oh, remember that sound?* And I’m like, *Yeah. Yes, I do.* 

Man: Yeah, I remember *loving* that video. Oh, *so good* with Sisqó. Yeah, we were just talking about how much we *loved* Maya.

Therapist: Jane, your body language is saying a lot right now.

Woman: What’s hard about this is that I think you *perform* a bit when you’re around other men.

Man: No.

Woman: Yeah. I think you were *performing* with them. You weren’t even laughing like yourself.

Man: *Well, you were doing a—* that’s how I *laugh!*

Woman: No, I’ve *never* heard you laugh like that.

Man: That’s how I laugh when I think something’s *actually* funny. That’s my *real* laugh.

Woman: *What? Actually funny?* Did you hear that?

Therapist: John, let’s try to refrain from using cruel or absolute language while we’re in here. *Outside* of here, you can do whatever you want. Not really, but you know.

Woman: I think it’s something that he does when he’s around men. And I don’t know if it has something to do with his dad, or if it’s something to do with *you.*

Man: Well, okay, *listen.* We have a therapist. We have a therapist *here.* Let *her* do her job, okay? You don’t— you’re being out of pocket, all right?

Woman: What does that even mean?

Therapist: I think what John means by *being out of pocket* is that you are crossing a boundary.

Man: Thank you.

Woman: Okay, *fine.* He was crossing *a lot* of boundaries when he was in this conversation.

Therapist: Yes.

Man: *What?* 

Woman: You were *being racist.* He was saying *racist things* about me.

Man: I wasn’t.

Woman: I know you’re not *low-key* Korean. Like, that’s obvious.

Man: I— no, no, no. I *do* recognize that in your individual communities, certain ways of communicating are permissible. But I think bonding over *racism* within that community *at your wife’s expense* is hardly the way to go about that.

Man: This— the problem wasn’t about *that.* Okay? It *wasn’t* about what I *said.* It was about what *she* did.

Therapist: Oh, so Jane closed it.

Man: Yeah. *Very, very aggressively.*

Woman: I am *so sorry.* This is one of the consequences of working from home. I’m just going to tell him I’m in a session.

Therapist: Okay.

Man: I’m just telling you, you’re *jealous,* and that you almost *got me killed.* 

Woman: *You almost got me killed.* 

Man: *I can’t even kill.* 

Woman: *I can save you.*

Man: *You can save me?* 

Woman: *I need to help.* 

Man: *I want you to die.*

Woman: *Are you dead right now?* 

Man: *Are you dead right now?* 

Woman: *Yeah. Are you?* 

Man: *Are you insane? Like, who do you think you are?*

Woman: *God is dead.*

Man: *Down, down. I’m not dying.*
